# Estimation of Gross Billings
I used Excel and Python for analysis and calculation. The historical data showed the seasonality of Groupon’s business. I cleaned the raw data by deleting the deals with unit prices higher than $100,000. And I used ordinary least squares regression to adjust the missing local deals on Oct 20-30, 2013. My estimate of Groupon’s 4Q13 North America total gross billing is $805.3 million. Pretending it is January 2014, before Groupon reports 4Q13 earnings in February 2014, based on the bad performance of Groupon stock in January and the lower estimate of Groupon’s 4Q13 North America gross billings, my recommendation is to sell Groupon stock.
